ARCS - a genome assembler for 2nd-generation genome sequencing
============================


ARCS is a de novo assembler designed for the 2nd-generation genome sequencing. It is based on de Bruijn graph model,for DNA sequence reads. It is based on Gene Myers' string graph
formulation of assembly and uses the FM-index/Burrows-Wheeler transform to efficiently
find overlaps between sequence reads. The core algorithms are described in this paper:

http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/12/i367

-------------
Compiling ARCS

ARCS dependencies:
    -glpk (https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/)
    -boost (http://www.boost.org)
    -log4cxx (http://logging.apache.org/log4cxx/)

If you cloned the repository from github, run autogen.sh from the src directory 
to generate the configure file:

./autogen.sh

then run make:
make

--------------
Installing ARCS

The execution of 'make install' will install arcs into /usr/local/bin/ by default. The install location can be specified by using the --prefix option to configureas below:

./configure --prefix=/home/arcs/ && make && make install

This command will copy arcs to /home/arcs/bin/arcs

-----------
Running ARCS

ARCS consists of a number of subprograms, together which form the assembly pipeline. Each program and subprogram will print a brief description and its usage instructions if the -h flag is used.

To get a listing of all subprograms, run arcs -h.

Examples of an ARCS assembly are provided in the benchmark directory. It is suggested to look at
these examples to become familar with the flow of data through the program.

The major subprograms are:

* arcs preprocess 

Prepare reads for assembly. It can perform optional quality filtering/trimming. By default
it will discard reads that have uncalled bases ('N' or '.'). If you wish to keep these reads, use the --permuteAmbiguous
flag which will randomly change any uncalled bases to one of [ACGT]. It is mandatory to run this command 
on real data. 

* arcs assemble

Assemble takes the output of the preprocess step and constructs contigs.
